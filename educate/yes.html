                <p>
                    For two decades, NRA’s Youth Education Summit (Y.E.S.) has brought 
                    some of America’s most bright, ambitious, and patriotic youth to our 
                    nation's capital each summer for a week of fun they'll never forget. 
                    Students engage with political leaders, visit historical monuments, 
                    and apply their skills in competitive debates, all to enrich and inspire 
                    the future of our nation. The mission of the Y.E.S. program is to help 
                    students explore our American government, Bill of Rights and the U.S. 
                    Constitution, while encouraging them to become responsible citizens who 
                    participate in the democratic process and return to their community with 
                    a proactive voice for the Second Amendment.
