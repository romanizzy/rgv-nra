            <h2>How Am I Supposed to Store My Gun?</h2>
            <p>NRA Guidelines and Recommendations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Store guns so they are not accessible to unauthorized persons.</li>
                <li>Mechanical safeties are not a substitute for proper storage.</li>
                <li>Use gun safes, locked cabinets, trigger locks, or cable locks.</li>
                <li>Store ammunition in a different locked location.</li>
                <li>Educate children using the Eddie Eagle GunSafe® program.</li>
                <li>Store in a cool, clean and dry area to maintain the condition of the firearm.</li>
                <li>Firearms should be cleaned regularly and kept in good working order.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Why are these rules important?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Secure storage is crucial to prevent accidental shootings involving children or other unauthorized individuals. </li>
                <li>Secure storage methods like safes make firearms less accessible to thieves. </li>
                <li>Responsible gun ownership includes safe storage practices to protect the community. </li>
