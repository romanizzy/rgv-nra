            <h2><span>How Am I Supposed to Store My Gun?</span></h2>
            <p>NRA Guidelines and Recommendations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Store guns so they are not accessible to unauthorized persons.</li>
                <li>Mechanical safeties are not a substitute for proper storage.</li>
                <li>Use gun safes, locked cabinets, trigger locks, or cable locks.</li>
                <li>Store ammunition in a different locked location.</li>
                <li>Educate children using the Eddie Eagle GunSafe® program.</li>
                <li>Store in a cool, clean and dry area to maintain the condition of the firearm.</li>
                <li>Firearms should be cleaned regularly and kept in good working order.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Why are these rules important?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Secure storage is crucial to prevent accidental shootings involving children or other unauthorized individuals. </li>
                <li>Secure storage methods like safes make firearms less accessible to thieves. </li>
                <li>Responsible gun ownership includes safe storage practices to protect the community. </li>

            <p>What Kind of Ammo? The right type depends on your gun.</p>

        <!--Pistol Brace Laws-->
        <section id="question-block">
            <h2><span>What are the current laws when it comes to pistol braces?</span></h2>
            <p>Current Status</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Federal law does NOT require you to register a pistol with a brace under the NFA (no tax stamp required), as long as it remains legally a pistol (not designed/made to be shouldered like a rifle)</li>
                <li>Braces are legal to own and attach under current federal law</li>
                <li>The underlying NFA definition of "rifle" is still undetermined, so if ATF argues a brace is being used as a stock, it could raise issues</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!--Difference between brace and stock-->
        <section id="question-block">
            <h2><span>What's the difference between a brace and a stock?</span></h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Pistol Brace:</strong> Designed to strap to the shooter's forearm, helping stabilize a 
                large-format pistol (like an AR-style) without making it a rifle. It was originally intended for disabled
                shooters.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Rifle Stock:</strong> Meant to be shouldered, which classifies the firearm as a rifle. If the barrel
                is under 16 inches and it has a stock, it legally becomes a short-barreled rifle (SBR) under the National
                Firearms Act (NFA), requiring registration and a tax stamp.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Why the difference?</strong></p>
            <p>The distinction comes down to intended use and classification under federal law. A brace is Legal
                on pistols because it isn't supposed to convert them into rifles, while a stock clearly does. 
                However, the ATF has shifted its stance over time on braces, and current rules may limit or ban
                certain brace configurations depending on how they are used.
