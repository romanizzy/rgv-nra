Commissioned by Isabella Farias-Maley
Created by Izabella Valero
This work was created for Isabella to for a RGV NRA presentation and is applicable for her peers to use even after her presentation. She wanted something clean and interactive so her peers are able to find resources in thier community. This is inclusive to safety classes, safety literature, ranges, gunsmiths, shops, professionals, and even commonly asked questions in her community.
About the website from a developer prospective
The site has a home page that displays the main core pieces that Isabella wanted to display. All items are abbreviated and have links that take them to pages with longer descriptions, more information, or sites with more relavant information.
The trickiest part of this site is creating an interactive map for users. The map needs to show indicators of location accurately, be spaced graciously so there is little overlapping of pins on the map, and be interactive so users can click a pin and display the place name and description. Interactive variables are tricky for the map itself but not for text display. This took considerable amount of js and css to cooperate properly.

Few links lead to new pages. The pages that have separate pages are connected to the Education for literature and classes, professionals and thier work, and frequently asked questions. For these a small database on excel was set up to accurately asses the date. This info has not been incorporated yet
